# 🏠 House Prices Prediction using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)

This project aims to predict house prices using **deep learning techniques** on the well-known **Kaggle House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques** dataset.
The model is implemented in Python, trained using a **feed-forward neural network**, and optimized to minimize error between predicted and actual sale prices.

---

## 📊 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a **regression model** capable of accurately estimating property sale prices based on a variety of numerical and categorical features (e.g., area, quality, neighborhood, number of rooms, year built, etc.).

The dataset provides detailed information on residential homes in Ames, Iowa, making it ideal for testing advanced regression models.

## 🧠 Model and Approach

1. **Data Preprocessing**

   * Handling missing values
   * Label encoding and one-hot encoding for categorical features
   * Feature scaling using `StandardScaler`
   * Log transformation of the target variable (`SalePrice`)

2. **Model Architecture**

   * Multi-layer **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** built using `TensorFlow`/`Keras`
   * Layers:

     * Input layer matching the number of features
     * Multiple dense layers with ReLU activation
     * Dropout for regularization
     * Output layer with linear activation
   * Optimizer: `Adam`
   * Loss function: Mean Squared Error (MSE)

3. **Training & Validation**

   * Data split into train and validation sets
   * Early stopping and dropout to avoid overfitting
   * Evaluation on validation data

4. **Submission**

   * Predictions inverse-transformed from log scale using `np.expm1`
   * Final submission file: `submission.csv`
   * Validated against Kaggle’s required format
